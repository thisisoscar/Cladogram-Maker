# Cladogram-Maker

This program lets you easily create an evolutionary, family or phylogenetic tree. You can add a branch to the tree by clicking anywhere and link them together by pressing ctrl+l. The program will automatically move them for you so you can easily create a tree. There are still some bugs though and I haven't finished all the functionality yet
